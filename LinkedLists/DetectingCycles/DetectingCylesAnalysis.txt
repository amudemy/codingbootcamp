Detecting Cycles 

When you are iterating the fast/slow pointer forward, if a cycle 
is present, then you will have fast and slow equal to each other
before slow reaches the end of the list. This is n iteration, which
results in O(n) runtime. 

LinkedList:
[A -> B -> C -> A]

(Initial)
Slow = A
Fast = B

(Loop 1)
Slow = B
Fast =  C

(Loop 2)
Slow = C
Fast = A

(Loop 3)
Slow = A
Fast = A
