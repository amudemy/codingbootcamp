Reversing a Linked List

As with reversing a string, there are multiple ways that
you can approach this problem. The interviewer is going to
want to know that you understand how Linked Lists function,
and that a SLL is made up of nodes that contain a value, and
a reference to another node.

Example
Input:
A -> B -> C -> null

Output:
null -> C -> B -> A
