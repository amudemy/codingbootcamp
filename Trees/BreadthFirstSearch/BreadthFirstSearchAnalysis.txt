Breadth First Search Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V + E) where V is the sum of the vertices, and 
E is the sum of all the edges. This is the same time complexity for DFS as well.


Why only an iterative solution for BFS?
The BFS algorithm is based on the queue data structure, recursion is based on a stack. Therefore,
the whole paradigm of the algorithm would have to change, and there isn't a straightforward way
to do that.
