Breadth First Search

An algorithm for traversing or searching a tree by traversing all nodes at the current level
before going on the next level.

Example:

			A
		B    C
	 D E    F

A BFS, an in-order traversal (where the left node is visited first) will yield the
following results:

B, A, C, D, E, F

What types of searches or traversals are BFS algorithms useful for?
One of the most popular applications of BFS is finding the shortest path between two nodes,
for instance Google Maps uses BFS to find directions between one location to another. BFS
is also used by Facebook to generate a social network for a particular person and to recommend
possible friends based on that network. Web crawlers also use BFS algorithms to collect
information about the most relevant sites and bring search results that have pages that
are the most linked. Bitorrent and any peer to peer application relies on BFS to find
nearby peers for faster data transfer.
