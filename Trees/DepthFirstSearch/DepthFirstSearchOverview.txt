Depth First Search

An algorithm for traversing or searching a tree by following each node to it's
deepest level before backtracking (going up to higher levels). For instance, in the
following tree, a DFS algorithm will reach the furthest node on the left subtree before
continuing to traverse the parent nodes and the right subtree:

			A
		B    C
	 D E    F

A DFS, in-order traversal (where the left node is visited first) will yield the
following order:

D, B, E, A, C, F


What types of searches or traversal are DFS algorithms useful for?
The types of problems that have the property of being deeply connected, ie traversing
a family tree (grandparents -> parents -> children) will give results that are in the
same family. Solving a puzzle like a maze that depends on previous steps, path between
two points, and drawing out decision trees that help analyze outcomes.
