MergeArrays Time Complexity

A simplified time complexity of this function would be O(n) if we
assume that the two arrays are of the same length. We'll assume
they're of different lengths and we don't know what those are, and
we'll call them n and m. Together, the time complexity of MergeArrays
would be O(n + m).

The space complexity would be similar, since we'll be adding the lengths
of the two arrays to form a larger array.

We're not going to consider the printing of the result as part of what
contributes to the time complexity since it's a one time task.
