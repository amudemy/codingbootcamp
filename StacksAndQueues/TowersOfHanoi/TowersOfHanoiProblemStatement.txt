Towers of Hanoi

You might have heard of this one before, or played it as a kid!
There are 3 towers - on one of the towers, you have n disks, stacked one on
top of each other in ascending size, from biggest at the bottom, to smallest
at the top. Your goal is to move the stack from the Tower 1, to Tower 3.

Rules:
1) You can only move one disk at a time
2) You can only place a disk at the top of another tower, and the disk
that is being placed must be smaller than the one above it.

Example

Input:
   -
  ---
-------  ________ _________
Tower 1   Tower 2  Tower 3

Output:

   					           -
  					          ---
________ _________	-------
 Tower 1  Tower 2   Tower 3

Keys to Solving:
Start with a base case.

For n = 1:
In this case, all you have to do is move 1 disk from tower 1 to tower 3.

For n = 2:
Move top of tower 1 to the spare tower, and then move the remaining disk from tower 1
to tower 3.

For n = 3:
Move top of tower 1 to spare tower, then we repeat what we've done for n = 2, but instead
of moving the 2 disks to the third tower, we move then to the second. Then we
move the last disk to tower 3, and then repeat once again what we did for n = 2.
This can be represented recursively as:
