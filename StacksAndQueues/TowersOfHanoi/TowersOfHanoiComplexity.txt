Towers of Hanoi Complexity

The complexity of the solution can be represented using this formula:
T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 + T(n-1) = 2T(n-1) + 1

Where T(n-1) represents moving n-1 disks to the spare tower, 1 move for
moving a disk from the source tower to the destination tower, and then
T(n-1) represents moving n-1 disks from the spare tower to the destination tower.

If we substitute different values of n, we can see that the complexity of this
solution is exponential, or O(2^n - 1).

T(1) = 2 * T(0) + 1 = 1
T(2) = 2 * T(1) + 1 = 3
T(3) = 2 * T(2) + 1 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7
T(4) = 2 * T(3) + 1 = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15
