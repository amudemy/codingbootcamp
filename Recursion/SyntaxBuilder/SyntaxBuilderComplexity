The complexity of this solution is O(4^n). If you print out the number
of results after each round, you'll notice an interesting sequence:
1, 2, 5, 14, 42... these are called Catalan numbers, and because we're making
a recursive call, the growth of these number is described as 4^n, mathematically.
This is an exponential time complexity, and it's the best case scenario for this
solution. The number of duplicate calls can be eliminated if we treat 
every parenthesis as it's own set, ie. "(" and ")" rather than "()".
