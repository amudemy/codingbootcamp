Max Difference Problem

This problem can also be referred to as the "max-profit"
problem, and it involves finding the maximum difference (profit)
in a series of values. Each integer can be imagined as a
stock price at the end of the day. At what day should you buy/sell
in order to make the maximum profit?

Example
Input:
[-1, 5, 0, 1, 2, -3]

Output:
Buy at Day 1, Sell at Day 2
Index values input[0] - input[1]
This will give a max profit of 6
