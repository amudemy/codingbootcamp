Reverse Sentence Complexity

When we are looping through the array and storing the characters
into an ArrayList, we are doing that n times. When we print out the
results, we are iterating through the list a total of n times.
If we count the printing time, this results in a O(2n) = O(n) time complexity.

How could this be implemented using a stack? (LIFO); extra storage for the stack

'cat' - > s.push(c) s.push(a) s.push(t) -> 

Last in first out:
while(!s.isEmpty()){
  s.pop();
}
 -> 'tac'
